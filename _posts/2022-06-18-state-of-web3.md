Bitcoin is below $16k. Web3 market is crashing. Was it all a big ponzi scheme?
And what can we learn from all of this? This is a small essay on my personal take on crypto space and
its relation to blockchain tech.

## Intro
Before we go into the discussion, I would like to make few clarifications of my personal distinction between crypto *(market, space, world, etc)* and blockchain.

* When talking about crypto I merely refer to any trading activities and services related to cryptocurrencies (liquidity, pools, exchanges, borrowing/staking, etc.). 
* In case of blockchain, I refer to any technology that utilises the concept of a decentralised ledger with consensus mechanism and sequential order of entries.

### Context
The reason why I decided to share my thoughts on this topic is ongoing (at the time of writing) crash of crypto market with bitcoin and ethereum hitting 2 years lows. 

I personally got interested in blockchain tech around 2 years ago. I was finishing the high school when I was offered an opportunity to work in a start-app developing a platform for launching DAOs on Solana. I was clueless of what the whole blockchain was and did not have any matching programming skills necessary to be any useful. So, even though I was kindly invited to a company's discord, I was kicked out after a month of my inactivity. This could be potentially the end of my involvement in blockchain. While surfing through Solana docs and blockchain guides, the tech caught my eye. I soon embraced the ideas of decentralisation and blockchain. That's how my journey began. 

It's very important to make clear that I am not an expert in blockchain or have sufficient understanding of trading, but I familiarised myself enough with blockchain to merely give my personal analysis on the future of blockchain.
