Conditional types in TypeScript allow you to create types based on conditions. Here's an example:

```typescript
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? true : false

const test1: IsString<string> = true // Valid
const test2: IsString<number> = false // Valid
```

Conditional types are particularly useful for creating flexible and reusable type definitions.
