Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allow functions to access variables from their outer scope. Here's an example:

```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
  return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
    console.log(`Outer Variable: ${outerVariable}`)
    console.log(`Inner Variable: ${innerVariable}`)
  }
}

const newFunction = outerFunction('outside')
newFunction('inside')
```

Closures are particularly useful for creating private variables and functions. For example:

```javascript
function Counter() {
  let count = 0
  return {
    increment: () => count++,
    getCount: () => count,
  }
}

const counter = Counter()
counter.increment()
console.log(counter.getCount()) // 1
```

Closures are a powerful tool in JavaScript, enabling encapsulation and modularity.
